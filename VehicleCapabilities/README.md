### Session 2 
#### Assignment 3 (Day 2)



Create a program to illustrate the capabilities of a vehicle. Incorporate other vehicle capabilities like sailing, flying, and driving to create various types of vehicles.

For instance, you can start from here:

 trait Vehicle {
  def move: String
 }

Que 1: Consider the following vehicle types

    a Car can be driven.
    a Boat can be sailed.
    an Aeroplane can be flown.

Create a class hierarchy for the above vehicle types. The class for each vehicle must implement the correct capabilities. The move() implementation for each Vehicle class must return a String. For example, if its a Car then it should return a String "Car can be driven"

Que 2: Also, Create vehicles with the following capabilities.
a) Flying cars: can be driven and flown
b) Hovercraft: can be sailed and driven
