##### Scala

#### Problem : 

###### Write a program illustarting 'equals' , '==', '!=' , 'ne', and 'eq' with different methods on how they can be used for different purpose.

###### Solution Description :

This Scala code contains an abstract class named EqualityInequalityOperators and its implementation in the CompareDifferentEqualityInequalityOperator class. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate the use of different equality and inequality operators in Scala.


EqualityInequalityOperators is an abstract class that defines five methods: useOfEquals, useOfDoubleEqual, useOfNotEqualsTo, useOfNE, and useOfEQ. These methods take two arguments of type T and return a boolean value indicating whether the two arguments are equal or not. The methods implement different equality and inequality operators available in Scala.

CompareDifferentEqualityInequalityOperator is a concrete implementation of the EqualityInequalityOperators abstract class. It provides implementations for all five methods defined in the abstract class.

The DriverMain shows the implementation of these methods on different values and list.

The test file has the test cases.
