### Day 4 Assignment - 1
#### SCALA

### Problem:


  Create an abstract class "CRUD operations" having 4 methods - create, read, update, delete. Create 2 classes and extend both of them with "CRUD operations" abstract class - one class would be using list to perform CRUD operations and the other class would be using seq to perform CRUD operations.
  
THe file contains three classes. 
abstract class- CRUDOperations
class to implement CRUDOperations on List - ListOperations
class to implement CRUDOperations on Seq - SequenceOperations

We can perform operations on list/sequence of any type, i.e the classes are defined generic and we can specify the type at the time of object creation.

Can see implemention in src/main folder and test classes are in test folder.
